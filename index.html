  <p>Working with cross-functional teams in an Agile and start-up like environment grew my passion for technology and project management and helped me become more versatile. Developing such competencies implies being more innovative, tech savvy and
    change-driven.

    My role as a Digital & Customer Experience Analyst for 2 years involved tailoring seamless end-to-end customer journeys and building digital products & services such as a CRM, a digital onboarding and a co-working space journey. This is where I
    got the opportunity to put to use my leadership skills through prioritization and taking decisions which allowed us to reach our goals.

    When I’m not on the job, I like to travel to exotic places and explore challenging activities such as ice climbing, scuba diving, hiking etc... I truly believe that these teach independence and compassion. They also widen your scope of knowledge
    and introduce you to cultures you haven’t experienced before. </p>
